Another implementation of WS2812 LED control through Arduino

Using a few basic examples from Arduino documentation, this can control a few WS2812 LED strips through serial communication.

A control program runs as a Linux terminal program, delivering commands to the Arduino through USB.

The Arduino then interprets the commands to adjust the attached LED strip colors.
